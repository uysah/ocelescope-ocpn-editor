# OCPN Editor

An OCPN Editor

An [Ocelescope](https://www.ocelescope.org) frontend module (`@instance/ocpn-editor`).

- `src/index.ts` — module definition (name `ocpnEditor`, label, routes)
- `src/routes/` — pages
- `src/api/` — typed API client for the `ocpnEditor` backend module,
  generated from its OpenAPI schema by `pnpm run build` (not committed)

Dependencies use `catalog:` versions from
[`@ocelescope/pnpm-plugin-catalog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocelescope/pnpm-plugin-catalog),
so the module needs to live in a pnpm workspace with that config dependency
(like an Ocelescope module project).

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm run build` | Regenerates the API client and builds the module into `dist/`. |
| `pnpm run dev` | Rebuilds on changes. |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Type-checks the module. |
